SMILE   Ver 2.0 ..Copyright (c) 1990,1992.. by: Michael Arnett


SMILE Viewer is an ANSI display/library utility that allows the user
to view files containing ANSI sequences, Music strings in BASIC
"PLAY" format and Sounds using a custom SOUND code.

SMILE builds and maintains a list of user selectable screens in a
file for each Directory selected.  This allows the user to add Artist
names and/or comments to each File Name using SMILE's built-in Edit
feature.  A text editor may also be used to edit the list file.  Line
length for File Name and Comments should be sixty characters or less.
The "³" delimiter should not be moved or altered when editing.  When
entering new lines, use ASCII character 179 to enter the delimiting
character.

NO ANSI DRIVER is required to view ANSI screens as SMILE contains a
built-in ANSI translator.  Keyboard reassignment codes are ignored.



GETTING STARTED:

SMILE Requires approximately 350K of memory to run.  This allows for
a large list of names to be displayed.  I tested with a list of more
1000 file names and full descriptions.  Options such as TAG, SORT and
SAVE take noticably longer with very large lists.


To run, place SMILE.EXE in the current directory, or in a directory in
your PATH, and enter SMILE at the DOS prompt. 

While loading, SMILE checks for the list file FILELST.DAT by default,
or the file specified by the /L command line switch.  If not found, a
list of files, in the current directory, ending in .ANS is built in
memory and displayed for viewing.

In earlier versions of SMILE, any changes to the current list were 
automatically saved to disk.  You must now select the SAVE option 
from the MISC menu while using the SMILE Viewer.  You will also be 
prompted to SAVE the list when you EXIT, if any changes have been made
to the list, if you change drives or directories, or if you load a new
list.  If you do a lot of list editing, please SAVE periodically to 
avoid loosing data to blinking lights etc.

Line length of displayed files MUST be 256 characters or less.  There
is no limit on actual file size.


COMMAND LINE SWITCHES  [optional]


/LFile   - "File" is the name of the list file you want loaded.

           Example:  SMILE /Lmylist.dat

/A:DRV:\PATH\FILE.NAM  - complete path of your ANSI editor.

           Example:  SMILE /A:C:\ANSI\THEDRAW.EXE

/E:DRV:\PATH\FILE.NAM  - complete path of your TEXT editor.  

           Example:  SMILE /E:C:\UTIL\QEDIT.EXE

/S       - disable "DOS SHELL" option.
/U       - disable "UPDATE\REBUILD" options.
/D       - disable "DELETE TAGGED" option.
/R       - disable "DRV\DIR" change option.
/I       - disable "EDIT INFO" option.
/X       - disable "ANSI\TEXT" Editor options.

/K       - KID PROOF  (invokes ALL of the above DISABLE options)

All or any combination of these switches may be used on the Command
Line with a SPACE between each one.  They need not be in any
particular order.



VIEWING FILES:

The main screen consists of several KEY COMMANDS and a display of the
first twelve files in FILELST.DAT.  You may scroll through all the
files using any of the cursor direction keys.  The bottom line of the 
scroll window contains the File Name of the current List File, total
number of file names listed and number of tagged file names.

Press ENTER to display the Highlighted file.

  MOUSE SUPPORT:

  Click the left button once to MOVE the highlight bar or doble click
  to view the highlighted file.  In most cases, the left button will
  act as the ENTER key, and the Right button acts as the ESC key.  USE
  the slide bar to scroll the list.

  *** Some early revisions of Logitech Mouse Drivers do not fully display
  *** the mouse cursor in EGA\VGA (43\50 Line) mode. 


SMILE will pause 

At the end of each screen display
If the SPACE BAR is pressed "during" display 
If CTRL-E is the first character of a line in the file.

Press any key to continue the display or ESC to cancel.


KEY COMMANDS:



LETTER or NUMBER Key:  Begins search on the sorted field for a match
     of the characters you enter.  Accuracy of the search increases
     with more characters.  For example, entering "a" will find the
     first line of text that contains an "a" anywhere in the text.
     The search is NOT case sensitive.  The highlight bar moves to
     the first "matched" record.  If your list is very large the 
     search could take a few seconds.

INS, SPACE BAR or RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON 
     TAG or UNTAG the Highlighted file.  You may select several or all
     of the File Names listed.  Files remain TAGGED even if they
     scroll out of the selection window.  Files are TAGGED with the
     current Display Speed and Display Mode.  By Toggling Display Mode
     and changing the Display Speed, it is possible to TAG files with
     different viewing characteristics.

F1   Displays brief HELP screen for each COMMAND KEY.  The
     SMILE20.DOC file will be displayed if there is sufficient memory
     and it is in the directory with SMILE.EXE.

     To ZOOM, MOVE, RESIZE or END this window, use the appropriate
     mouse triggers or F5 to Zoom, CTRL-F5 to Move, ALT-F5 to Resize,
     or ESC to End.

F2   TAG or UNTAG every file that matches your selection, (ALL, VIEWED
     NON-VIEWED or USER DEFINED) including those not visible in the
     selection window.  The DEFINE option prompts for a search
     string.  This would allow tagging by Artist.  The entire File
     Name and Comment field is searched for the specified text.
     Files are TAGGED with the current Display Speed and Display
     Mode.


F3   Displays each TAGGED file consecutively. You can select to be
     prompted for a key press after each file is displayed, or view
     NON-STOP.  If you select NON-STOP you can adjust the number
     seconds delay (1-99) between each screen or pause.

F4   Toggle Music ON or OFF.  This determines whether or not you
     hear music if it is contained in the displayed file.

F5   Turns Edit Mode on and allows editing the artist name and comment
     information.

F6   Toggle between 25 line and 43/50 line (EGA/VGA) mode if available.


F7   Select Display speed.  Selections simulate modem baud rates.
     Select 0 (default) for the fastest display.  Speed selections
     include:
   
        19,200, 9600, 2400, 1200, 300


F8 - LIST OPTIONS

     SAVE  The current List is saved to the specified File Name.
           Press ESC to cancel save.

     LOAD  The List file name specified is loaded into memory.

     UPDATE  Updates the current List with new files that match the
           current File Mask.  Existing artist\comment information
           is retained.  File names that have been erased from the
           directory are deleted from the list. If you see the
           message: "FILE NOT FOUND" when viewing, select this option
           to refresh the file name list.  You may also use a text
           editor to delete file names from FILELST.DAT that are not
           needed or no longer exist.

     REBUILD  Removes the current List from memory, then rebuilds
           using the currently selected File Mask.  You will be
           prompted to save the current list if any changes have been
           made.

     SORT  You are prompted to sort alphabetically on File Name or
           comment field.  Press ESC to cancel.

     DELETE TAGGED  You may select to delete tagged file names from
           the LIST, from your Disk Drive or BOTH.
         

F9 - Change FILE MASK, DRIVE or DIRECTORY. You may enter any DOS
     compatible File Name or wild card.

     EX.  *.*,  *.ANS,  *.MSG,  ???.*,  SMILE.ANS

     Press TAB to move between File Mask, Directory, Drive and Button
     fileds (ALT-O Ok, ALT-C Cancel, ALT-H Help).  Selecting Cancel
     or pressing ESC will close the window with no changes.
     Otherwise, you will be prompted to UPDATE or REBUILD the file
     list.  (See explanations above).

     If you change drives or directoies, and changes have been made to
     the current list, you will be prompted to SAVE the list.  The 
     default List Name will change to FILELST.DAT.  If not found
     in the new directory, it will be created.
    

F10  MISCELLANEOUS OPTIONS

     ANSI Editor  You are prompted for a drive, path and file name if
          the /A: command line switch is not used, or the specified 
          file can not be found.  The highlighted file name is passed
          to the editor.
          
          Testing was done using TheDraw versions 3.3 and 4.01.  It
          required approximately 586K of memory to load SMILE 2.0
          and run version 4.01 with this option.  Version 3.3 required  
          significantly less memory to run under this option.

     TEXT Editor  You are prompted for a drive, path and file name if
          the /E: comand line switch is not used, or the specified 
          file can not be found.  The highlighted file name is passed
          to the editor.

     ** NOTE **  any executible file (EXE/COM) may be run using the 
                 options avove provided there is sufficient memory.

     FILE INFO displays Size, Date and Time of Highlighted File Name.

     DOS SHELL  Type Exit to return to SMILE

     SYSTEM MEMORY is displayed in a window.

     SYSTEM TIME is displayed in a window

     EXIT You may select this option or press ESC at the main screen
          to exit SMILE.  You will be prompted to SAVE the current 
          File List if any changes have been made.

ALT-X   Fast Exit from SMILE.  No prompts are displayed.  
        *** ANY CHANGES TO THE CURRENT LIST WILL BE LOST ***




          MUSIC:
     
          Syntax: ESC[MF T120 O2C8D8E8F8G8 (DEC 14)
     
          Music strings in the BASIC Play format are supported.
          Multiple strings per line may be entered.  
     
          Music strings should begin with the characters "<esc>[M"
          where <esc> is a true ESC character (DEC 27, Hex 1B).
          Please refer to your BASIC manual for information on the
          BASIC Play commands.  The following are all valid for
          beginning a Music string in SMILE: MF, MB, MN, ML, MS, M .
          Although MB (Music Background) is valid, true backgroud    
          music is NOT supported.
     
          Music strings should end with the musical note character
          (DEC 14, Hex 0E, CTRL-N).  If this character is missing,
          SMILE will look for the next ESC character or the
          end-of-line marker to terminate the music string.  This
          option was added to try and catch as many incorrectly
          formated music strings as possible.  However, for
          compatiblity with other viewers, I suggest you always end
          your music strings with CTRL-N (DEC 14)
     

     
          SOUND: 
          ( Thanks to Julie Ibarra, author of ANSIPLAY for this idea )
     
          Syntax: 
          ESC[MF Freq; Duration; Cycles; CycleDelay;Variation (DEC14)
     
          Custom Sounds are supported in SMILE by using a SOUND CODE
          similar to that found in BASIC and the program ANSIPLAY.
          However, the SOUND generator in SMILE differs from the
          SOUND command in BASIC.  Therefore, different frequency
          values must be used to produce the musical notes.  These
          are listed somewhere down the page.
     
          The SOUND statement must begin and end in the same manner
          discussed above for a normal music string.  The SOUND CODE
          consists of the following parameters serparated by a
          semicolon (;) :
     
          FREQ     : Frequency of note to be played.  The affective 
                     range of frequencies is 0 to 7904.  
                     (0..65535)
          
          DURATION : Time, in milliseconds, the note should be played.  
                     (0..65535)
     		
          CYCLES   : Number of times to repeat Frequency/Duration.
                     (0..65535)
     		
          DELAY    : Time, in milliseconds, between cycles.  
                     (0..65535)
     		
          VARIATION: Frequency value is changed by this number for
                     each CYCLE the note is played.  
                     (-65535..65535)
     
     
          (NOTE: 1 second = 1000 milliseconds)
     		
     
          Press ESC to exit a DURATION or DELAY action.  You may
          have to press ESC a couple of times to completely exit
          a sound sequence.
     
          SOUND CODE Musical Note Frequency Values (7 Octives):

          One advantage of the SOUND CODE is the ability to place a
          PAUSE in your ANSI screens without having to use a
          multitude of ESC[s codes.  Just use a SOUND CODE with the
          DELAY set very high to get a pause.  For example,
     
          ESC[MF ;;;60000
     
          would pause your ANSI Screen for 60 seconds, or until a key
          is pressed when viewing it with SMILE.  Remember, these 
          SOUND CODES are not supported by bulletin boards...(yet)!
